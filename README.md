This is the code repository for the paper " Using CycleGAN," developed as part of the CS 548-12 course instructed by Dr. Michael J. Reale at SUNY Polytechnic in Fall 2023. The contributors to this project are Gavin Gillogley and Dillon May. The project utilizes Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (cycleGANs) to generate images from sketch images.
